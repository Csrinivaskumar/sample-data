Newly-appointed Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian, affectionately called as ‘Subbu’ by his friends and colleagues, is an “outstanding choice for the job”, according to those who have worked and are currently working with him.

Currently an associate professor at the Indian School of Business, Mr. Subramanian has written about a number of economic and financial topics ranging from demonetisation to labour laws, CEO compensation, and even crime data. Apart from that, those who know him say he is a very good singer and is a polyglot, fluent in Tamil, English, Telugu, Hindi and Bengali.

A sharp student, Mr. Subramanian ranked 159 in the IIT-JEE and was selected to do a B.
